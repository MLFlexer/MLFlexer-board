Files for my keyboard

The keyboard is based on the QuefreQuefrency Keyboard from keebs.io.  
The case it from: https://github.com/keebio/quefrency-case

the layout is created with keyboard-layout.com: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8bcdc40ffeae6a050a385e37f04cbcdb

of which the raw data from keyboard-layout.com is then converted to .svg/dxf-files using: https://kbplate.ai03.com/

## The build requires:
- nice!nano V2 Wireless Controller × 2
- Diodes × ~100 (1 per switch)
- Lithium-Polymer Battery × 2 (at least 100 mAh per battery)
